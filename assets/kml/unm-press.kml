      <description>The Press moved here in 2007, bringing together all the main offices and warehouse. However, various issues resulted in the Press offices being moved to 1717 Roma Ave NE in the fall of 2009. The warehouse remained based here until 2017, when it was permanently shut down. Fulfillment and distribution were subsequently outsourced to Longleaf.</description>
