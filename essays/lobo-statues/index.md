# The Lobo

Among the numerous public art installations on campus, you'll encounter many iterations of the University's mascot, the Lobo. First suggested in 1920, the Lobo is a recognizable and beloved school symbol, representing teamwork and fearlessness.[^mascot] Let's take a tour of the statues around campus.

## Lobo In Tight Grove

{% include figure.html class="img-right" width="48%" height="100" caption="Sculpture Dedication. December 8, 1997." src="images/lobo-tight-grove-5.jpg"%} 

Where might you encounter a real Lobo? While it is unlikely you'll ever stumble across a Mexican grey wolf in the wild, you _can_ find them in the mountain ranges of New Mexico. But, with a bit of wonder, you can imagine encountering one in its natural habitat with a visit to the Lobo in Tight Grove. Situated among century-old ponderosa pines, you'll find the UNM Lobo surveilling the corner of University and Central. The statue, sculpted by Michelle Middleton and cast by Richard Wortman, was a gift from the Alumni Association in 1997 to commemorate its 100th anniversary. [^tightgrove]

The Lobo finds an apt home in the man-made forest on the edge of campus. Tight Grove, a cluster of ponderosa pine trees and Rio Grande cottonwoods transplanted from the Sandia Mountains, was created by and named for then-University President William George Tight and the students who transplanted the trees in 1905.[^tightgrove2] Tight Grove and the Lobo statue serve as a peaceful retreat on campus and a reminder of the state's natural beauty.

# John Tatschl's _Lobo_

The oldest of the lobo statues, John Tatschl's _Lobo_, has been a staple of campus since its unveiling in 1947. Tatschl, an Austrian artist and professor, began his career at the university the year prior and quickly became known for his contributions to art across campus. The Lobo statue was the first such work, followed by _The History of Writing_ in the Zimmerman Library stairwell, the colorful glass wall of the College of Education Building (formerly Travelstead Hall), and the altar screens inside the Alumni Memorial Chapel. Outside of artwork at the University, Tatschl constructed many other bronze statues across the country

_You know, quite often after looking at something for ten years, you want to disown authorship. But on the contrary, I look back on my work ten years later and I'm still proud I made him._ - John Tatschl [^tatschlquote]" %}

Unlike the lobo statue in Tight Grove, Tatschl's _Lobo_ does not conform to a realistic style. Rather, the _Lobo_ reflects "the mechanized streamlined artistic styles utilized by some post-war Modernist artists."[^libguides] Aside from the abstraction, the _Lobo_ measures larger than the Mexican grey wolf at approximately 4 feet high and 7 1/2 feet long. Tatschl, in a 1961 interview for the _New Mexico Lobo_, stated he believed the statue to be the only bronze statue between El Paso and Denver. Today, Tatschl's lobo is one of many bronze statues on campus alone. 

### Construction of the Lobo

Approached by either the student government or the fraternities and sororities on campus, Tatschl was commissioned by a university group to create a plan for the statue in the spring of 1947. The student group wanted to erect a memorial statue to honor the students and alumni who lost their lives during World War II.[^archive] By homecoming of the same year, he completed the statue. The bronze lobo was constructed in half a year for just $2800. When the statue was relocated in 1961, the cost of the new pedestal and hoists to move the statue was roughly $600. 

Various delays pushed back the statue's dedication, including difficulty fundraising. Following the Lobo War Memorial dance sponsored by the Interfraternity Council on November 7, funds were finally secured. The statue was presented to the University President J.P. Wernette during the half-time activities of the New Mexico-West Texas football game on November 29, 1947.

Tatschl's Lobo has made many homes across campus throughout its nearly 80 years. Originally placed outside Zimmerman Stadium, it was moved following the stadium's relocation and demolition in the 1960s. From its second home mounted atop a 20-foot-high stone pedestal, near the Stanford and Central entrance, the Lobo welcomed students and visitors from the median. Currently, it resides between Johnson Center and Johnson Field on the east side of the building. 

### Hodgin Hall Lobo

Can't get enough of Professor Tatschl's _Lobo_? You'll find an oversized replica of the head of Tatschl's original Lobo outside Hodgin Hall. The replica was completed in June 1985 by the Shidoni Foundry in Tesque, New Mexico. The bronze statue is a donation to the University and Hodgin Hall by Eleanor and Dr. Randy Seligman.[^hodginhall]

## _Spirit of the Lobo_
Lurking among the trees and bushes of central campus, you'll encounter smaller bronze lobo statues in various poses. The statues were donations to the University during the 2014 _Spirit of the Lobo_ campaign. The campaign, begun by then-University President Robert Frank, set out to commemorate what it means to be a Lobo through the installation of permanent bronze statues throughout the community. Purchased through the UNM Foundation, the statues were available for $5,000, with the opportunity to install them either on campus or elsewhere. Each statue on campus has a plaque thanking the donors. Similar to the Lobo in Tight Grove, the 36" lobo statues are realistic representations of the school mascot. [^unmnews]
