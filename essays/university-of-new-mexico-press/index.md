## Introduction

The University of New Mexico Press has been a fixture of UNM for nearly a century. Compared to many of the other long-standing institutions on campus, though, the Press has been shifted between many different locations over the years. Currently, it is based out of 1717 Roma Avenue NE, to the west of Dane Smith Hall and north of the Anthropology building; this location was first constructed as the Alpha Chi Omega sorority house in 1930-31, following the establishment of its UNM Chapter in 1918. The Press occupies the first floor and basement of the building, with one office on the upper level (the rest are reserved for overflow from Scholes Hall across the street and to the east). The Press is New Mexico's one major book publisher and handles various regional projects, as well as scholarly books alongside poetry collections and fiction. Its history is long and storied, and, as far as becoming part of UNM goes, properly begins in 1929—incidentally, the same year that the ball got rolling for the construction of its current base of operations.

## Origins of the Press

Even though it would not be until the fall of 2009 that the Press would come to be housed within 1717 Roma, both may not have existed if not for the efforts of UNM President James Fulton Zimmerman. It was Zimmerman who encouraged the building program for fraternities and sororities, which manifested as a subdivision on Roma named Sorority Row, and he was also the figure who brought the Press to campus. On June 1st, 1929, UNM's Board of Regents unanimously approved the establishment of the Press. However, the Press was not started from scratch. A conglomerate of organizations based in Santa Fe—the Museum of New Mexico, the School of American Research, the Historical Society of New Mexico, the New Mexico Archaeological Society, and the New Mexico Geographical Society—had previously banded together to establish the El Palacio Press, which published the periodical _El Palacio_. _El Palacio_ began life as a monthly publication that covered scientific, literary, and art news of the Spanish Southwest, and it soon became the first weekly publication devoted to archaeology and museum activities. It was first published in November 1913 and was based inside the Palace of the Governors, whose name it was derived from.[^Palacio]

Dr. Zimmerman entered into a cooperative agreement with the director of the Museum of New Mexico and the School of American Research, Dr. Edgar L. Hewett, which meant that the entire Press was transplanted from Santa Fe to UNM in 1930. On July 15th, Paul A. F. Walter, Jr. was hired as the assistant director for both the Museum of New Mexico and the School of American Research, as well as the director of publications at UNM. The first equipment was moved over sometime in August or September of that year. The press's name initially remained El Palacio Press, but as people increasingly referred to it as the University of New Mexico's press, the name stuck. At the time the UNM Press began operations, it was the only one located between the University of Oklahoma and the West Coast.

### The First Location of the Press

In a similar vein, the first building the Press was housed in was already established. In the summer of 1921, Mrs. Jacob Korber and her son A.P. Korber gifted UNM $500 to pay for equipment for a wireless telephone and telegraph station. It conducted its first radio broadcast on December 16th, 1921. While it was initially based in the Science Hall, in 1925, two small buildings were built for the Station. UNM had high hopes for the Korber Wireless Station, proudly boasting that its towers were "destined to be of great service to this region."[^Korber] It closed the very next year because it was too expensive to operate. 

After that, one of the buildings was reappropriated as a music studio for a short time, before the Press ultimately ended up inhabiting both of them. At the time, the buildings were connected by an outdoor boardwalk. In 1934, the Buildings and Grounds Department was able to double the size of the Press by removing the shared walls between the two buildings and constructing a roof over them both. The resulting structure was joined to Carlisle Gym and still stands to this day; the US government's Works Progress Administration helped make the renovation possible. It was further expanded in 1938, when Professor William E. Burk of the School of Architecture donated his services to both double the space within the building once again and to remodel it in the Pueblo Revival style. The Press occupied the building until 1949. The former Korber Radio Station buildings would come to house the Office of Veterans' Affairs and the Counseling and Testing Division, and remain standing to this day as a facilities management structure.

### Early Press Operations
For its first 3 years, the Press was little more than a printing facility for UNM. UNM had conducted some publishing prior to the establishment of the Press, including catalogs, internal materials, and some booklets, from 1898 onward. Their first ever booklet publication was published under the auspices of the "Hadley Climatological Laboratory" and was titled "Physiological Corrolaries of Equilibrium Theory of Nervous Action and Control."[^AHS] At first, the Press's output was largely comprised of similar material. Its first publications were pamphlets, while it also published booklets in the Bulletins series. Their equipment, though, was used to print works for UNM staff and other individuals, and some of these were credited to the Press. Technically, their first-ever hardcover book release was _Givers of Life_ by Emma Esterbook, which was published in 1931. However, the Press does not classify it as their first release because they did not advertise, distribute, or catalog it themselves. Their first true release was _New Mexico History and Civics_ by Lansing B. Bloom and Thomas C. Donnelly (the future president of New Mexico Highlands University) in 1933. This was also the year that Fred E. Harvey was hired as the Press Director.

Between 1933 and 1943, the Press published 56 total books. Book publishing wasn't a focus of the Press at first, as they were busy handling the catalogues for UNM and its graduate school, as well as an increasing number of bulletins. They leased their machinery and equipment from the School of American Research until 1935, when the Press acquired it for $5,000. Additionally, as part of UNM, plans were made for a University literary publication with a distinctly Southwestern flavor, in the form of the _New Mexico Quarterly._

### The Future Location of the Press
The agreement for the construction of the Alpha Chi Omega sorority house was made on April 19th, 1930, between the "ALPHA CHI OMEGA BUILDING ASSOCIATION OF NEW MEXICO" and architect Beula Fleming. The house was finished sometime in late December of that year or in early January 1931. It was outfitted with a three-tier fireplace, a grand piano, and other amenities. The initial sketches for the building differed from the final layout; the living room originally protruded out more from the rest of the house, with a fireplace nestled in its bottom left corner, and a conservatory room adjacent to it was dropped entirely. The dining room and kitchen were also made flush with the reoriented living room. Additionally, the original plan called for a porch on the exterior facing west; this did not come to fruition, with one instead being built along the walkway to the entryway door.

The third is a picture of the structure shortly after construction was finished, which is largely identical to the current building aside from the lack of the 1950 addition and the double doors being removed; the step leading up to it does still remain, but the doors were walled off and a window was inserted where they once stood.

## Growing Pains
The Press faced many challenges early on in its life. For nearly the first decade of its life at UNM, the Great Depression was raging, and during at least one summer, the Press lacked the money to pay its personnel. Its first home also wasn't terribly well-suited to the Press's operations; floor space for the UNM Press Plant reportedly had only ever been adequate shortly after each stage of new construction. Operating in under 4000 square feet of space not only made it impossible for the Press to add any new machinery to their operations, but the established machinery was so crowded that it was allegedly dangerous. In the fall of 1943, President Zimmerman asked Joseph A. Brandt, then-director of the University of Chicago Press, to visit the UNM Press and provide feedback. Brandt's response in 1944 did offer some praise for the press even existing, and he also commended the organization of the plant, but he stated that it was understaffed, underfunded, and underequipped. During the 1930s and 1940s, the press's staff ranged from 4 to 8 people, which limited just how much they could achieve. Additionally, due to being the only prominent publisher in a 400-mile radius at this time (and for years to come), many Press staff lacked top-level publishing experience. Brandt offered a multitude of recommendations for improving the Press's operations, including aiming to publish 6-10 new books per year across 2 seasonal lists, making production money available for books in a composite budget, preparing for a loss of $10,000 to $15,000 annually, and making the plant a formal division of the Press. The following reorganization took place against the backdrop of thousands more students coming to UNM, in part due to the GI Bill that brought in an influx of World War II veterans. It resulted in the press taking on a broader publishing program as well, with less of a focus on scholarly material.

That's not to say there weren't any positive developments with the Press around this time. In 1949, construction on the Journalism Building wrapped up, and the Press plant found a stable, suitable home within it. It occupied the entire first floor, and was the most complete university plant in the Southwest. Scholastic societies based outside of New Mexico sometimes contracted with the plant simply because they were that satisfied with the quality of their printing, and their employee count rose to 30 staffers.

%}

However, it cannot be said that the Press's editorial offices fared quite as well. By 1948, they'd already moved into a building directly southwest of their initial location, roughly where Clark Hall stands now. Within a few years, though, they'd moved to a temporary structure to the northeast of the Library (which had not yet been named for Zimmerman), labeled as T-21 on the campus map. It was part of a collection of buildings that mostly served as women's dormitories. During this time, they were able to expand and establish distinct editorial, art, sales and promotion, and shipping and bookkeeping departments, as well as a clerical staff. They also produced some books on behalf of the University of Arizona, whose press existed in name only until 1959. However, 1956 brought on more tough times for the Press, including a near-total reorganization. The idea was combining the Press, _New Mexico Quarterly_, and _Publications_ series into a single department while making printing operations independent. The entirety of the Press was laid off so that the new editor of publications, Roland Dickey, could appoint a new staff, though one of the affected employees did end up staying on as an office manager.

Afterwards, though, the Press was left in a relatively good position. In 1957, the offices moved into a 10-suite room in Marron Hall, which had once been a dormitory itself, across the street from the printing plant in the Journalism Building. They remained there until September of 1964, when they moved into a space on the second floor of the newly completed west wing of the Journalism Building that was designed specifically for their line of work. Apparently, this was its sixth location on campus, meaning at some point, the offices had occupied yet another place on UNM campus. The Mailing Department was also relocated to the Journalism Building, while the basement of Mesa Vista Hall was used as auxiliary warehousing for slow-selling inventory. This flooded regularly, which ruined books, but let the Press collect from the state of New Mexico's self-insurance for property damage. Around this time, the UNM Press had also accrued a substantial foreign business, mainly with Central and South America.

### 1717 Roma Expands
The architect Louis G. Hesselden was brought on to design and build an addition to the Alpha Chi Omega sorority house in 1950, which included a new lounge, bathroom, laundry room, and a "town girl's room," as well as a few other renovations like an additional shower in the second floor bathroom. A door at the end of the upstairs hallway was also added to access the roof of the expansion, which was intended as a sun deck. The basement was left untouched, though the building's foundation was updated to accommodate the new left side of the house. The lounge now serves as the Press's entrance room.

## Changes in the 1960s

  %}
Under the leadership of Dickey, the Press wound up building a sizable backlog of manuscripts awaiting publication, which resulted in Frank H. Wardlaw, director of the University of Texas Press, conducting an inspection of their operations in 1965. Wardlaw saw Dickey as a friend and did go easy on him at first, but he realized that the alternative could be someone far less sympathetic filling his role. The most pressing issue was that a book could languish in production for five to six years before being published, though Wardlaw also stated he felt that sales efforts, particularly advertising, were suboptimal. He encouraged the UNM Press to outsource to manufacturers in the Eastern US to clear up their backlog, and also advised bringing bookkeeping, shipping, and warehousing under the Press's control in the future, as other UNM programs still handled those at the time. Dickey would leave the Press at the end of 1966 to join the University of Wisconsin Press, with Roger W. Shugg being hired to assume directorial duties. Shugg was the first truly professional director the UNM Press had. However, Shugg couldn't move to New Mexico for full-time work, so two joint directors served until July 1st, 1967, when he was able to begin his tenure. Shugg made a substantial push to increase the Press's output; in his first year, the Press published 16 books, whereas in the three years prior, they'd only released 19 books. Production control was also tightened soon after Wardlaw's examination, though it took until 1975 for the Press to handle its own shipping.

1717 Roma Avenue NE went through a particularly radical shakeup in the 1960s. In October 1965, the Board of Educational Finance approved a University revenue bond issue to finance various endeavors, such as the construction of The Pit, an Olympic pool, the Laguna and DeVargas dormitories, and the La Posada dining hall. Simultaneously, they approved UNM's purchase of the Alpha Chi Omega fraternity house. The sorority had outgrown it, and they subsequently moved into a new, larger house in a Spanish colonial style.

%}

So...what did UNM use their newly acquired building for? Well, it was first designated as the location for the offices of the Institute of Meteoritics. 1717 Roma only housed them very briefly, though. The Institute was already in a period of relaitve inactivity after its director retired in 1962, and while they had a full-time researcher between 1966 and 1967, he soon left. By the end of March 1967, the office of International Programs and Services had taken up residence in 1717 Roma, where it would remain well into the 1980s.

## The Press Hits its Stride
Under the direction of Shugg, the UNM Press flourished into the 1970s and beyond. While still mid-sized, Shugg's efforts helped attract more top regional and faculty authors to the Press (after they had ironically struggled to secure manuscripts from UNM staff and were also relatively ignored in New Mexico despite having the pull to secure reviews in prominent places like the _Los Angeles Times_), to the point that it commanded equal respect to the Oklahoma and Texas university presses. Its growth was rapid, publishing five times as many books and boasting an annual business nearly four times greater than just four years prior—and that was with two fewer full-time employees. 76.4% of purchases were made from buyers outside of New Mexico. And this was all at a time where the Press was not accepting works of fiction or poetry; they instead referred authors who submitted such works to them to other publishing houses. Shugg's goal was for around 50% of the Press's books to be regional and the other 50% to be of general interest, with half also coming from UNM employees and associates, with a third of books being profitable so that the Press could be self-sustaining, or very close to it. At the same time, press employee Jack Rittenhouse pursued an initiative to revive out-of-print regional texts.

There were still some difficulties: in particular, the plant was no longer competitive because its photo composition system was obsolete, forcing the Press to outsource some projects to keep their prices economical. This was inconvenient and cost the plant both time and money. Additionally, the sales force of the Columbia University Press had begun representing the Press in the Eastern US starting in 1971, but by late 1976, they had since made arrangements with another 8-9 presses, and the one they had established with the UNM Press was no longer satisfactory. Thus, the directors and marketing managers of the University of Washington, the University of Texas, the University of Texas A&M, Brigham Young University, the University of Oklahoma, and the University of New Mexico Presses founded a new marketing consortium called the University Marketing Group. And over the Thanksgiving holidays in 1977, a cold front plunged temperatures to 10°F. This caught the University off guard, as to conserve energy while classes weren't in session, they had set temperatures inside buildings to 58°F. The resulting damages cost UNM an estimated $800,000 to $1 million in damages, largely because of pipes bursting. The UNM Press offices were among those affected, in addition to the Press's former home in Marron Hall and its future residence of 1717 Roma Avenue NE—at the time referred to as the "UNM Personnel Department." However, none of these setbacks kept the Press from maintaining strong momentum into the future, under the direction of Luther Wilson, who became press director in 1980.

The 1982-1983 fiscal year was particularly significant for the Press, as for the first time, they crossed the million dollar mark in gross sales, raking in $1,180,305. Returns totaled $86,285. Elizabeth Hadas took over Wilson's position as director in 1985. In 1989, the year when the Press made its next move in location to a strip mall at 1700 Lomas Blvd NE (adjacent to University), they had a record sales year totaling $3 million, and published over 50 books; UNM also received national and international accolades for its press's output. Yet all that paled in comparison to a success that stemmed from a relatively innocuous rights acquisition Hadas made in 1986. She paid a few hundred dollars to secure the rights to a book called _The Education of Little Tree_ by Forrest Carter, a memoir about the childhood of a Native American boy raised in the mountains of Tennessee. 

In 1991, its paperback edition topped the _New York Times_'s nonfiction bestseller list. It sold over a million copies, making it the highest-grossing book the Press has ever released. 

But it was a little too good to be true. _The Education of Little Tree_ wasn't just discovered to be a fictional work masquerading as an accurate account after the fact. It was found that Forrest Carter was a pseudonym for the late Asa Earl Carter, a Ku Klux Klan member, anti-Semite, and white supremacist who had authored some of the most famous speeches of the notorious Governor George Wallace of Alabama. The _New York Times_, who broke the story in October 1991, subsequently moved the book to the fiction side of the bestseller's list, which killed its status as a chart topper.

%}

With that said, though, UNM Press largely escaped from the crosshairs of the controversy. The very next year, Elizabeth Hadas was actually elected the president of the Association of American University Presses, where she served a standard year-long term. In fact, _The Education of Little Tree_ received a film adaptation after the fact that flew under the radar due to being released the same day as James Cameron's _Titanic_, and the book still sells well, its backstory often being overlooked. So why exactly has the book still endured despite where it came from? As Hadas put it, "Even though the author had terrible values, the book espouses excellent values." _The Education of Little Tree_ is too far removed from Asa Earl Carter's beliefs for them to really impose themselves upon the content of the book. While the UNM Press published it under the perception of it being a memoir, it helped launch a renewed initiative from them to publish literary works, alongside the 1992 release of _Alburquerque_ by Rudolfo Anaya. Its sales also enabled the Press to hire more staff, publish some pricey photography and art books, and supply employees with a good deal of educational travel. The sheer success of the book even allowed the Press to be self-supporting for a time. It's a complicated situation, but the Press does still recognize the book as part of their history.

## To the Present Day
Amidst the Press's unprecedented success, 1717 Roma quietly shifted from housing the Office of International Programs and Services to UNM's Human Resources administration. Plant fund accounting was also noted as being handled on the premises in the mid-1990s, though it was considered the Human Resources building first and foremost.

In 1991, remodeling commenced at the Journalism Building, and it was only then that the press plant followed the editorial offices to 1700 Lomas Blvd NE. All the insurance claims made on flood-damaged books eventually proved handy in securing a dedicated warehouse for the Press, built in the early 1990s at 3700 Spirit Drive SE adjacent to Sunport runways to house the entire inventory of the Press. The business department and order fulfillment department also moved into the warehouse, alongside part of the marketing department.

In December 2004, demolition began on the Lomas location to build the UNM John & June Perovich Business Center, though parts of the original building were retained. While the Press continued to place a portion of its inventory in the back half of the Business Center for several years after the fact, its main offices were relocated to 1601 Randolph Road SE, where University Blvd briefly terminates. However, plans were soon underway for a new home for the Press, which would again consolidate all its operations under a single roof. The warehouse on Spirit Drive was sold to help finance this new base of operations, constructed at 1312 Basehart Road SE. In the fall of 2007, the Press moved in...and was met with a rude awakening.

%}

First, a flood took place. Then cracks began to form in the floors and walls, with one nearly being two feet deep. The building had been built in an unorthodox manner because a second story that could be rented out was hastily added to the construction plan, and so it ended up with bizarre support beams, including ones that ran diagonally and in front of windows. This, coupled with the construction workers not digging deep enough to properly ground the building, was the cause of it beginning to break apart. The strain of the unplanned additional floor was too much for it to bear. Newly added rods that drilled deep into the Basehart location's foundation were needed to shore it up.

Other issues plagued the Press at this time as well. They had been under the assumption that the Basehart building would be theirs, and invested money in it accordingly, but it turned out they were merely renting it from UNM, which caused some confusion and frustration. UNM Central Administration then effectively evicted the Press to allocate the Basehart location's newly built offices to a biology research institute that had been awarded a multi-million-dollar, multi-year grant for an international project. They were threatening to move their program to another university, which drove UNM to find a way to keep them around. As for the Press...well, UNM told them they could relocate to 1717 Roma Ave NE, and said it'd make for a better arrangement because no rent payments would be necessary. That fall, the Press made the move, though the warehouse remained at Basehart until 2017, when it was shuttered permanently. Fulfillment and distribution were then outsourced to Longleaf.

## The Press at 1717 Roma/Conclusion

1717 Roma stands as the Press's third-longest tenured location, after the original Korber Building(s) and the Journalism Building. It has also marked a less tumultuous era of its history, with less major developments outside of being placed under the jurisdiction of the Zimmerman Library in 2020, offering benefits like the existence of a fundraising department. A Little Free Library was affixed to the Press sign out front on May 9th, 2025.

Throughout its own long life, 1717 Roma has changed quite a bit, even from the original vision for the building. Comparing both Beula Fleming and Louis G. Hesselden's sketches of its layout to up-to-date maps reveals some intriguing insights.

Walls were torn down to open up many rooms, though others were divided up further. For example, the dining room the Alpha Chi Omega girls ate in was divided into an extension of the old check room, a small kitchen space, and offices for the business department. What was once the Alpha Chi Omega living room was split into five rooms, while the fireplace was concealed behind drywall.

Perhaps where the building's history shines through most clearly is in the Ernest R. Earick Memorial Library, though. Even in the adjacent hallway, a gap in the floor trim marks where a door once stood, leading to the matron's room originally and the housemother's reception room in Hesselden's time. Even inside the room, though, there are distinctive signs left behind. A small divot in the ventilation jutting down from the ceiling, now propping up some _New Mexico Quarterly_ magazines, marks where a closet once was. In the back-right corner, the ceiling opens up where another door once stood. A protrusion that links with the vent is all that remains of a bathroom. It is quite appropriate that a building with such a storied history is now home to an organization focused predominantly on putting stories and histories out into the world.
