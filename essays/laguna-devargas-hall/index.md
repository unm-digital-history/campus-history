Laguna DeVargas Hall (LDV) is one of the most distinctive and more classical residence halls at UNM. Having been built during the late 60s, construction for the dorm finished in 1969 and was praised for its unique and fresh design. Each suite accommodates up to six residents, providing a balance between privacy and community living. This suite-style design was introduced to provide a more modern and comfortable living space, with shared bathrooms and common areas that encourage social interaction. And depending on which room you get, you may even see a beautiful view of the Sandia Mountains standing proudly in the distance when on the 3rd floor!

## Interview with the one and only!
In the gathering for the ways of DeVargas, my team and I were able to spot and ask DeVargas some questions about himself along with quick facts. In my time spent with him, I collected the vibe that he was a very chill and down to Earth being...well, you kinda need to be down to Earth if you want to be a functional building. Please take a listen to this little snippet of the interview with DeVargas found here.
