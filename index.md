# Campus Histories
Walking around campus, it’s easy to assume that the space around us has always been this way. Or it simply _is as it should be_. But every building, pathway, and tradition has a story to tell—stories of vision, change, resilience, and progress.

## Why campus histories matter
Exploring UNM's history builds a sense of identity and belonging among students, faculty, and alumni. By learning about the people, events, and traditions that shaped an institution, the campus community develops a deeper connection to not only the physical spaces, but the **places** they have become over time.

Our campus histories also provides valuable historical perspective on contemporary issues. Understanding how we as an institution have responded to challenges and milestones gives students crucial insight into how past decisions shape present realities—and on their own role in continuing to shape the future.

## The power of collaboration
This site represents more than just a collection of historical facts; it’s an example of what digital humanities can accomplish. Students over several semesters built this site collaboratively using open-source tools, learning how to create, share, and maintain knowledge on the web. Working together—even experimenting with “pseudo-code” and drafts along the way—develops digital literacy and empowers participants to become contributors, not just consumers, of online content.

We hpoe a well-documented, digitally accessible campus history invites new students, faculty, and supporters to connect with a place that values openness, participation, and meaningful storytelling. It ensures that achievements, struggles, and traditions are remembered and celebrated for generations to come—while building the digital skills necessary to shape future stories.
